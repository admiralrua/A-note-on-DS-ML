# Softmax regression

## Briefing

Softmax Regression \(synonyms: Multinomial Logistic, Maximum Entropy Classifier, or just Multi-class Logistic Regression\) is a generalization of logistic regression that we can use for multi-class classification \(under the assumption that the classes are mutually exclusive\). In contrast, we use the \(standard\) Logistic Regression model in binary classification tasks.
